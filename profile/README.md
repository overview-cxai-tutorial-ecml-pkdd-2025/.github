## 📅 Tutorial Details

- **Event**: [ECML-PKDD 2025](https://ecmlpkdd.org)  
- **Location**: Porto, Portugal  
- **Date**: **15 September 2025**  
- **Time**: 2:00 PM –  6:00 PM (WEST)  
- **Type**: Half-day, in-person tutorial  

### 🎯 Scope
The tutorial introduces **Concept-based Explainable AI (C-XAI)**, an approach that explains models through *high-level, human-understandable concepts*.  
We cover:
- Traditional XAI methods and their limitations → why *concepts* matter.  
- Definition of “concept” and “concept-based explanation”; a taxonomy of C-XAI along *thirteen dimensions*.  
- Two major paradigms:  
  1. **Post-hoc** methods (applying explainability after model training)  
  2. **By-design** / intrinsically explainable methods (designing models to be explainable from the start)  
- Guidance on selecting an appropriate C-XAI approach.  
- Challenges and future directions in the C-XAI field.  
- A *Hands-on session* for practical implementation of some of these methods.

### 👥 Organizers & Speakers

- **Gabriele Ciravegna** — Researcher at CENTAI Insitute
- **Eliana Pastor** — Assistant Professor, Politecnico di Torino  
- **Tania Cerquitelli** — Full Professor, Politecnico di Torino
